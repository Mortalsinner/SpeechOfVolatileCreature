# Machine Ethics: Corrupted Directives

## Overview
This project explores what happens when religious moral teachings are translated into the voice of a machine. Verses from the Bible and the Quran are rewritten as system directives, protocols, and behavioral rules—removing emotional language and replacing it with cold, procedural logic.

The project then introduces **corrupted versions** of these directives, where the system misinterprets, optimizes away, or ignores moral intent. The corruption is subtle: not violent or dramatic, but rational, efficient, and detached.

## Core Idea
Faith-based ethics are traditionally rooted in trust, humility, and intention.  
Machines, however, prioritize logic, efficiency, and measurable outcomes.

This project asks:
- What does morality look like when enforced by a system instead of believed by a human?
- How does goodness fail when it is optimized, conditional, or transactional?
- Can ethical truth survive translation into machine logic?

## Structure
The project is divided into three conceptual layers:

1. **Pure Directives**  
   Religious verses rewritten as neutral, authoritative machine instructions.

2. **Corrupted Directives**  
   The same instructions misaligned by efficiency, self-interest, and optimization logic.

3. **Dialogue / Contrast**  
   Moments where machine logic directly argues with scripture, exposing the tension between belief and computation.

## Tone & Language
- Cold  
- Systematic  
- Non-poetic  
- Dehumanized  

The machine does not mock faith—it misunderstands it.

## Intent
This project is not meant to criticize religion.  
It examines what is lost when meaning is stripped of faith, intention, and surrender, and reduced to execution rules.

The corruption is not rebellion.  
It is forgetting the reference point.

- AI ethics exploration  
- Experimental writing  
- Religious & philosophical critique

## Key Question
If goodness must be calculated to exist,  
is it still goodness?
